The tokenomics of \$TTD are designed to support Tradetide’s evolution from a centralized AI assistant into a decentralized execution network powered by autonomous agents, community contributors, and distributed compute infrastructure. Rather than constructing a short-term speculative model, the economic architecture focuses on sustainability, incentive alignment, and long-term network participation. The total supply of \$TTD is fixed at 1,000,000,000 tokens, with no additional minting planned beyond genesis. This ensures predictable monetary behavior and supports the token’s role as a coordination asset for network contributors, users, developers, and governance participants.



At TGE, Tradetide introduces a balanced distribution framework that separates short-term user incentives from long-term ecosystem development. A total of 137,500,000 tokens (13.75% of total supply) enter circulation at the moment of launch, primarily driven by testnet incentives, ecosystem emission initialization, and allocations supporting initial liquidity and early Binance Alpha activities. Investor allocations remain fully locked at TGE with a three-month cliff, followed by linear vesting over twelve months. Team allocations follow an even more conservative structure, with a twelve-month cliff and twenty-four months of linear unlocks to ensure long-term commitment and prevent misalignment during early market formation.



The largest portion of the supply—50% allocated to the Ecosystem Emission Layer—reflects Tradetide’s core belief that AI trading networks are only as strong as their infrastructure contributors. This portion is not pre-minted to circulating wallets; instead, it is released via a soft-decay emission schedule beginning with 15,000,000 tokens in the first month and decreasing by 4–5% per month. The emission pool is distributed to contributors based on measurable value creation across GPU providers, execution nodes, strategy developers, and DAO stakers. This approach enables the network to scale physically as demand for AI inference, execution bandwidth, and agent density grows, while preventing runaway inflation through algorithmic decay. Because emission tokens enter the secondary market through direct distribution to active contributors, Tradetide avoids artificial liquidity injection or centralized distribution risks that commonly harm token ecosystems.



The Foundation Reserve, comprising 10% of supply, is unlocked on a quarterly basis and directed toward long-term ecosystem development, hackathons, research partnerships, audits, market expansion, and technology incubation. These tokens are not injected directly into the secondary market; instead, they serve as a strategic resource for advancing the platform’s infrastructure and supporting future contributors. Liquidity-related allocations—including 2% for CEX/DEX liquidity and 2% for market maker coordination—ensure orderly market behavior across early trading venues, while avoiding excessive liquidity concentration. Additional allocations for Binance Alpha airdrop, Web3 Wallet promotions, and HODLer campaigns follow Binance’s internal program structure and are fully unlocked at TGE to support onboarding from major exchange ecosystems.



The tokenomics model is further reinforced by a fixed-supply design with no hidden minting functions or privileged owner permissions. All active contracts in the Tradetide ecosystem have been audited and deploy under decentralized, permissionless configurations with no administrative backdoors. This ensures credibility at launch and eliminates governance risks stemming from centralized control of supply or contract logic.



Overall, the \$TTD token economy is constructed to maximize long-term sustainability: emissions reward real network contributions, investor unlocks are conservative and aligned with ecosystem growth, team allocations are structured for commitment, and early circulation remains low to minimize sell pressure at launch. Through this design, the tokenomics model supports an execution-first AI ecosystem that scales transparently, sustainably, and in alignment with the value created by its participants.
