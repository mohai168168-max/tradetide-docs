\$TDTE's token economic model is designed to support Tradetide's evolution from a centralized AI assistant to a decentralized execution network driven by autonomous agents, community contributors, and distributed computing infrastructure. This economic architecture is not built on a short-term speculative model, but rather focuses on sustainability, coordinated incentive mechanisms, and long-term network participation. The total supply of $TDTE is fixed at 1.2 billion tokens, with no further issuance after the genesis phase. This ensures predictable monetary behavior and supports its role as a coordinating asset among network contributors, users, developers, and governance participants.

On TDTE, Tradetide introduces a balanced allocation framework that separates short-term user incentives from long-term ecosystem development. A total of 660 million tokens (55% of the total supply) enter circulation at launch, primarily for testnet incentives, ecosystem initialization, and allocation to support initial liquidity and early OKX Wallet activities. Tokens allocated to investors are partially locked during TGE, and ecosystem rewards have a three-month lock-up period, followed by linear unlocking over twelve months. The team allocation employs a more conservative structure, with a twelve-month lock-up period followed by linear unlocking over twenty-four months. This ensures long-term commitment and prevents conflicts of interest in the early stages of market formation.

A portion of the supply—22% allocated to the ecosystem issuance layer—reflects Tradetide's core philosophy: the strength of an AI trading network depends on the strength of its infrastructure contributors. This portion of tokens is not pre-minted into circulating wallets; instead, it is released gradually through a soft-decay issuance plan, with 15 million tokens issued in the first month, decreasing by 4-5% each month thereafter. The issuance pool is allocated based on the measurable value created by contributors such as GPU providers, execution nodes, strategy developers, and DAO stakers. This approach allows the network to physically scale as the demands of AI inference, execution bandwidth, and agent density increase, while preventing runaway inflation through algorithmic decay. By distributing tokens directly to active contributors to the secondary market, Tradetide avoids the risks that typically harm the token ecosystem, such as artificial liquidity injections or centralized distribution.

A base reserve of 10% of the total supply, unlocked quarterly, is used for long-term ecosystem development, hackathons, research collaborations, audits, market expansion, and technology incubation. These tokens will not be directly injected into the secondary market; instead, they serve as strategic resources to advance platform infrastructure and support future contributors. Liquidity-related allocations—including 2% for centralized/decentralized exchanges and 2% for market maker coordination—ensure orderly market behavior in the early stages of trading while avoiding excessive liquidity concentration. Additional allocations for the OKX Wallet airdrop, Web3 wallet promotion, and HODLer activities follow Binance's internal planning structure and will be fully unlocked at the Token Launch Conference (TGE) to support user onboarding from major exchange ecosystems.

The token economic model employs a fixed supply design, without any hidden minting functions or privileged holder permissions, further enhancing its reliability. All active contracts in the Tradetide ecosystem have been audited and deployed in a decentralized, permissionless configuration without any administrative backdoors. This ensures credibility at project launch and eliminates governance risks arising from centralized control of supply or contract logic.

Overall, the $TDTE token economy is designed to maximize long-term sustainability: token issuance rewards contribute directly to the network, the investor unlocking mechanism is robust and aligned with ecosystem growth, team resource allocation prioritizes commitment, and early circulating supply is kept low to minimize selling pressure at launch. Through this design, the token economic model supports an execution-first AI ecosystem that scales transparently and sustainably, aligning with the value created by participants.
