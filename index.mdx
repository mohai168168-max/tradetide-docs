🌊 Tradetide — Execution-First DeFi Trading Agent
Tradetide is the first execution-first AI trading agent for crypto.

Multi-timeframe strategy simulation with real-time market data.
-One-Click Execution (In Development)
Direct trade execution via Binance, OKX, and leading DEX APIs.
-Goal-Driven Agents (Planned)
Users set return targets and risk tolerance; agents autonomously manage portfolios.
-Strategy Marketplace (Planned)
Copy, subscribe, and monetize trading agents from community and professionals.
-Autonomous Alpha Agent Network (Vision)
Decentralized execution infra + SDK for developers + DAO governance powered by $TDTE token.
