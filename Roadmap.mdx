**Q4 2024 — Foundational Research & Prototype Development**

Tradetide began in late 2024 with a deep technical exploration of how AI could be combined with decentralized execution systems. The team researched time-series forecasting models such as LSTM and hybrid LightGBM stacks, sentiment analysis powered by Transformer encoders, and reinforcement-learning–based execution frameworks capable of handling real-time order flow. In parallel, the team experimented with DEX routing simulations across AMMs and Uni-V3-style liquidity structures. These prototypes formed the conceptual and architectural groundwork for what would later evolve into the Smart Analysis engine. During this stage, the project validated its hypothesis: AI agents must be execution-first to create real value.

**Q1 2025 — MVP Completion & Early Testnet Deployment**

During the first quarter of 2025, the team focused on building a functional MVP centered around AI-driven token insights. The early version introduced core features such as multi-indicator analysis, volatility profiling, and short-term directional reasoning. A closed alpha was deployed to a small group of testers, and the public testnet was gradually rolled out. The feedback confirmed a critical insight—users valued analysis, but reliable execution tools were the larger unmet need across the ecosystem. This insight drove the shift toward the execution-first philosophy that defines Tradetide today.

**Q2 2025 — Seed Funding & Testnet Expansion**

In the second quarter of 2025, Tradetide secured seed investment from CGV, CatcherVC, K24 Ventures, Candaq Ventures, and Stratified Capital. These partners accelerated product development and provided access to industry networks. The public testnet grew rapidly, crossing 40,000 on-chain users and building a multi-region community of more than 150,000 members across X, Telegram, and Discord. This wave of adoption provided a real-world data foundation for refining models, optimizing latency, and improving UX across analysis and strategy reasoning.

**Q3 2025 — Smart Analysis Public Launch & Backtesting Engine Completion**

By the third quarter of 2025, the Smart Analysis module reached public availability, offering real-time AI insights for any token ticker or contract address. Users could obtain technical evaluations, risk metrics, and actionable trade ideas through a single, unified interface. At the same time, the multi-timeframe backtesting engine completed its development and entered final QA, designed to support simulation of strategies across diverse market conditions. These advancements established Tradetide as a fully operational AI assistant while preparing the infrastructure for the execution layer.

**Q4 2025 — TGE Preparation, Execution Layer Development & Ecosystem Model Finalization**

The fourth quarter of 2025 marked a pivotal milestone. Tradetide finalized its execution integration with Binance and OKX APIs, began internal testing of one-click execution flows, and expanded DEX routing for the BNB Smart Chain. The token model was also completed, including the Ecosystem Emission Layer — a 22% allocation designed to incentivize GPU providers, execution nodes, and AI agent developers through a soft-decay emission curve. With the token generation event (TGE) scheduled for December 22, 2025, the project prepared security audits, exchange submissions, and DAO governance frameworks ahead of launch.

**Q1–Q2 2026 — Execution Rollout & Cross-Chain Expansion**

Following TGE, the primary focus for the first half of 2026 is the deployment of the execution pipeline. This includes the official release of one-click execution for CEX spot and derivatives, risk control modules, configurable stop-loss/TP logic, and automated execution wrappers for AI agents. Tradetide will also expand beyond BNB Chain, integrating Ethereum and Arbitrum to support a broader range of trading venues and liquidity environments. During this period, the backtesting engine transitions to full production status, forming the complete pipeline of analysis → simulation → execution.

**Q3 2026 — Launch of Goal-Driven Portfolio Agents**

The third quarter of 2026 introduces the first iteration of goal-driven portfolio agents. These agents allow users to define high-level intent—such as “10% monthly target with 5% maximum drawdown” or “low-volatility yield optimization”—and delegate decision-making to autonomous systems. These portfolio agents continuously rebalance assets, manage exposure, and deploy orders based on market conditions and user preferences. This marks Tradetide’s transition from an assistant tool into a semi-autonomous trading agent ecosystem.

**Q4 2026 — Strategy Marketplace & Developer SDK Release**

Late 2026 focuses on the creator economy surrounding AI agents. The Strategy Marketplace opens to developers, quantitative researchers, and professional traders, enabling them to publish, monetize, and distribute AI-powered strategies or autonomous agents. Concurrently, the Tradetide SDK will be made available, allowing third-party teams to build AI-driven execution agents that integrate directly into the platform. Combined with the emission incentives for strategy developers, this establishes a sustainable developer ecosystem.

**2027–2028 — Autonomous Alpha Agent Network & DAO Governance Layer**

From 2027 onward, Tradetide enters the final stage of its long-term vision: the creation of a decentralized execution network powered by autonomous alpha agents. These agents operate as persistent, evolving entities distributed across chains, capable of executing orders, optimizing portfolios, and interacting with other agents. The network is secured by execution nodes, GPU providers, and DAO governance participants, all coordinated through $TDTE incentives. This stage unlocks the full potential of AI-driven finance, enabling a global, permissionless ecosystem where intelligent agents trade, cooperate, and compete across venues.
